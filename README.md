Some jank Javascript I wrote to rapidly validate a network map. I wasn't aware of async, so I wrote my own. (I was offline at the time it was written.)
The keyword there is jank. It will work though. It helped get top marks in a few competitions.

Use at your own risk. The custom async I wrote isn't perfect. Keep the number of machines you'll scan with at a reasonable number.
